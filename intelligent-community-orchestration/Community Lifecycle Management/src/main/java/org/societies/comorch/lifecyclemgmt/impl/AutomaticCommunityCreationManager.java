/**
 * This is the class for the Automatic Community Creation Manager component.
 * 
 * The component is responsible for automating, and triggering the process of 
 * suggesting to one or more relevant CSSs, the creation of CISs and sub-CISs. This 
 * is achieved by perform various forms of analysis on CSSs, CISs, their attributes, and their
 * connections, and using different algorithms. Social network analysis methods and similarity of users
 * -based approaches and algorithms will be used, including an
 * approach that views groups/CISs as either ongoing (non-terminating, with no deadline or 
 * fulfillable purpose for existing) or temporary (not going to last, e.g. because it exists just
 * for a goal that will be completed, or has a clear lifespan, or group breakdown is inevitable).
