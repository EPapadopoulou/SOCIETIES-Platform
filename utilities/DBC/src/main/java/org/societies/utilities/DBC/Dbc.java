/**
 * 
 * Class provides a Design by Contract (poor man's version) type mechanism for an implementing class. The contract is not visible
 * outside of the implementing class but JavaDoc comments on parameters can convey the contract to consumers. There are three types of checking:
 * 1. Preconditions: conditions that the passed parameters must comply with
 * 2. Invariants: conditions that are considered to be invariant by the class
 * 3. Postconditions: conditions that the returned parameter must comply with
 * 
 * Exceptions will be thrown if the conditions are not met resulting in a hard and fast code failure. This allows class consumers and the class
 * itself to detect erroneous parameters and states quickly and at the point of initial detection. Exceptions can optionally have user defined
 * messages which is another channel by which the contract is exposed to consumers.
 * 
 * The main rationale behind this implementation is to avoid the Java assertion mechanism which would achieve the same effect but can be 
 * turned off and so its effects are negated.
